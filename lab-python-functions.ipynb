Now, let's take it a step further and refactor the code by introducing functions.\n","\n","Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:\n","\n","1. Define a function named `initialize_inventory` that takes `products` as a parameter. Inside the function, implement the code for initializing the inventory dictionary using a loop and user input.\n","\n","2. Define a function named `get_customer_orders` that takes no parameters. Inside the function, implement the code for prompting the user to enter the product names using a loop. The function should return the `customer_orders` set.\n","\n","3. Define a function named `update_inventory` that takes `customer_orders` and `inventory` as parameters. Inside the function, implement the code for updating the inventory dictionary based on the customer orders.\n","\n","4. Define a function named `calculate_order_statistics` that takes `customer_orders` and `products` as parameters. Inside the function, implement the code for calculating the order statistics (total products ordered, and percentage of unique products ordered). The function should return these values.\n","\n","5. Define a function named `print_order_statistics` that takes `order_statistics` as a parameter. Inside the function, implement the code for printing the order statistics.\n","\n","6. Define a function named `print_updated_inventory` that takes `inventory` as a parameter. Inside the function, implement the code for printing the updated inventory.\n","\n","7. Call the functions in the appropriate sequence to execute the program and manage customer orders.\n","\n","Hints for functions:\n","\n","- Consider the input parameters required for each function and their return values.\n","- Utilize function parameters and return values to transfer data between functions.\n","- Test your functions individually to ensure they work correctly.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
